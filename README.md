## Overview

A colorimeter is a laboratory device used to measure the absorbance of light at specific wavelengths in a given solution. Colorimetry is based on Beer-Lambert’s law, which states that the amount of light absorbed by a colored solution is directly proportional to the solution’s concentration and the length of the light path through it. When light passes through a sample solution, part of it is absorbed, while the remaining light is transmitted. By comparing the color intensity of a solute in the sample solution to that of a reference solution with a known solute concentration, we can estimate the concentration of the colored solute in the sample. Colorimeters are commonly used in fields such as water analysis, environmental analysis, and laboratory research.

Colorimeters, if accessible to households, could be used for practical applications like food quality control, water testing, and gardening. For instance, they could help ensure the freshness of fruits based on their color, test the purity of tap water, or analyze soil nutrients for home gardening. These applications could contribute to health, food safety, and environmental conservation efforts at a personal level.

## Features

- **Wavelength Selection**: Choose from multiple wavelengths for diverse compound analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Real-time display of absorbance levels.
- **Calibration**: Built-in calibration features to enhance accuracy.
- **Portable and Cost-effective**: Designed for affordability and portability for lab or field use.

## Components

- **RGB LED Light Source**: For various wavelengths (red, green, blue).
- **LDR Sensor**: Detects light transmission through the sample.
- **Arduino UNO**: For processing the signals.
- **I2C LCD Display Module**: Shows the measured values and calibration data.
- **Cuvette Holder**: Holds the sample for measurement.
- **Push Buttons**: For user Interaction

## Circuit Design

The circuit uses an RGB-LED light source directed toward a cuvette containing the sample solution. A LDR Sensor opposite to the light source detects the light that passes through the solution. The microcontroller calculates absorbance based on the intensity of the transmitted light.
